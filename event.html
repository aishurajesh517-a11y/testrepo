A 100-word paragraph is a concise piece of writing that conveys a focused idea, similar to a short essay, and typically includes an introduction, supporting details, and a concluding sentence. For example, a paragraph about a personal experience like a first day of university could describe the initial feelings of awe and excitement, the new friendships formed, and the unique learning environment. Alternatively, a 100-word paragraph could summarize a larger topic, like the environmental benefits of sustainable practices at home, by highlighting key actions such as recycling and reducing water usage, and the long-term positive outcomes. 
Structure: A good paragraph includes a topic sentence, supporting details, and a closing sentence to stay focused. 
Personal Example: A paragraph about the first day of university can capture the sensory details and emotions, from the scale of the library to meeting new people and the slightly intimidating seriousness of research scholars. 
Informative Example: A paragraph about sustainable living can be used to introduce the topic and its importance by briefly touching on methods like recycling and the benefits of saving resources and money. </p>
